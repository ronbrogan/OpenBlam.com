All flood combatants (non-carriers) are spawned in a group, `qz_cov_def_flood`

Waves will progress when there is 1 or 0 enemies remaining in the group

The phantom will spawn 5 seconds after there is 1 or 0 enemies remaining in the group after the last wave spawns

After triggering the phantom, the game will wait until the phantom is 'done', or will wait 2 minutes

The phanom is 'done' after there are no flood from group `qz_cov_def_flood` present in the end trigger volume.
